  <h2>Usage Guide</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Setup/Installation</li>
          <ul>
          <li>In order to be able to ship our code to others around campus while avoiding potential lisencing issues, we will not be bundling and and sending dependancy modules with our packages. Therefore, we must teach all package users how to install external dependancies. Images may be helpful, but in the name of spacial preservation and simplicity, let's be frugal. If you have a code for them to copy and run in the command line, use a coding backtick. They look like this `. So you could say, "please open a command prompt and paste the following code 
          `npm i example-project -g`, if they need any packages for your code.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Usage</li>
        <ul><li>Cover the main use cases of the package. Once again, use only as much detail as is needed to use the product in each of the general use cases that the consumer will need. Images may be helpful, but remember the aboce constraint.</li>
        <li>Use backticks to give copy and paste examples.</li>
